# ruby-adjudicator

---

## NOTE: This project is on hold

I have not abandoned the world of online diplomacy, as I am working on a web interface for a new webdip site (which has about the same goals as rails-diplomacy, but whose backend is a lot more complete than that). The time I spent on `ruby-adjudicator` is dear to me, and I'd be happy if someone used it. Let me know if you do.
